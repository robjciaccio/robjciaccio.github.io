  Hopefully It's not too confusing starting on day twelve as apposed to day one... It didn't occur to me to start this blog until the other day, most likely because the first ten or so days of your bootcamp are like being at an amusement park. You never know what is going to fly at you next. Let's recap the first 12 days.

  The first step after being accepted was the most stressful... Financing. To my surprise, it wasn't all that bad. I have to say that SkillsFund is a solid company and they are very helpful and easy to get ahold of on the phone. 
	
	Once financing was taken care of I got to work. The first few days I started to lightly dabble in Learn.co (the online learning paltform). It was strange, i had been so excited to get started and now I was afraid to dive in. After doing a few lessons here and there, monday rolled around and I recieved a few emails. These emails informed me to sign up for an orrientation as well as a study group which was more of a touch base with other students to check goals and progress.
	
	This was the beginning of what Flatiron refers to as "the online expirience". I have been going to college online for a year, and I expected this to be exactly the same, boring and lonely. I was wrong! It was actually amazing to be able to hear students, who months ago were in my same position, talking about their progression on their final projects. After this I spoke with my educational coach, Tracy, and I was able to have a face to face conversation (over the internet of course). I was able to ask all the questions I wanted, and I never felt rushed as if she had another person to talk to. 
	
	To top all of this off I was then introduced to Slack. Slack is a form of chatroom. You login with you learn.co credentials and then you are able to join mulitple different rooms that you may be interested in. I never thought I would find this interesting, but I'm finding myself becoming very involved. As you check in frequently you start to realize that its just an open chat full of people who are having the same expiriences as you. 
	
	To wrap this up I will quickly touch on what I actually did today. i was off of work today so I commited to doing 14 lessons before I called it quits. From my conversation with Tracy I learned that to complete the program in 5 months (my goal), you must complete 7 lessons a day. On my days off I would like to complete double that (14) to be sure I'm giving myself room for error. 
	
	What I actually learned today. I am still in the introduction to Ruby segment of the bootcamp. I learned that taking notes with evernote is AMAZING! as for coding, today I learned: loops, iterations, nested arrays, and enumerables. I believe out of the 15 lessons that I completed today, I had 7 labs. Most went very smoothly, however one of the earlier labs that I had to complete took me 3-1/2 hours. I have found this to be the challenge when trying to plan your day and make goals. Some labs take ten minutes, some take hours. 
	
	I think thats enough for today. Expect posts in the future to be much shorter.
