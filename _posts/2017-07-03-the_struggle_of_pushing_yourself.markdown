It has been a really busy few weeks. I currently live in Florida and every summer my parter and I have a month long streak of visitors. These visitors make working consistently, a challenge. The program is also very difficult right now. I am currently on my first project which is the scraping project. I am confident that I will be able to do it, and I am very excited. My issue is that I do not know how consistently I will be able to work on it, so I am afraid to start. 

I have decided today, that I need to put more time into the program. Even if I'm not working on any specific labs, I want to be practicing. I want this to become a hobby, as I want to love what I do.
