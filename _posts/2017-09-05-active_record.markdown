Today I finished the section on ActiveRecord. Life has been pretty stressful of late, and all of this stress is ending with a move across the country to NYC. Through everything that has been going on lately, I only wish that coding was as easy to learn as it is to forget. Lately Ive only had about one day a week to really sit down and knock out some learning. This is fun when starting a new section because you are refreshed and ready to go. When you are trying to pick up where you left off a week ago, you spend the first half of your time refreshing what you already forgot from last week. This stress should end once i'm finishe with my move at the end of this week. I plan on being able to give over 40 hours a week to my studies in NYC. 

As for ActiveRecord, I thought that SQL was actually a very enjoyable language. It was definitely tedious, but i always found myself enjoying writing it. Then enter ActiveRecord, its like any feedback I could have ever dreamed of was already written down and turned into the beautifullness that we know and love as active record. 

The ease of relationships such as belongs to or has many is now a simple task. creating tables is as easy as entering a prompt into your terminal. ID numbers are given by default. The perks of ActiveRecord are too many to comment. 

My favorite part thus far in this program is that instead of teaching the easy ways to do things, we learn the hardest possible way to do something first. This method makes the respect as well as the understanding of the easier way something that everyone will appreciate.
