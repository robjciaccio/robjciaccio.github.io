I feel like whenever you take on a challenge in life you hear about the Click. 

For the last two weeks I have been stuck on Object Oriented Ruby. i will forwarn future students, this is not easy topic. I have truly been stairing at the same lab for two weeks, completely lost. What I was doing incorrectly was I was trying to face this alone. This changed today. I reached out to the community by simpling stating, "I'm really struggling with OO Ruby". 

The amount of responses I recieved blew me away! within five minutes i had about 20 tips from multiple students, and to my surprise, within 30 minutes i was talking to the dean of the school. Together, I recieved a ton of tips of videos that I had either seen or maybe skipped over. 

After watching the videos, and talking with Avi (the dean) as well as a few different learn experts, it happend... The click. Suddenly after two weeks of believeing that I was never going to get it, it all came together. I had been working on the same lab for two weeks and was barely halfway done. I finished the rest of it in about twenty minutes and I haven't looked back since.

I am certain that these setbacks will happen again, but I have never felt more confident in the community here at Flatiron. I actually look forward to my next setback because I know that there are so many people like me who have had the same struggles, as well as the same feelings of accomplisment afterwards.
