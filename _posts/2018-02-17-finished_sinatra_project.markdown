I have to say that I fell off of the wagon for a few months. I moved to NYC, and life became absolutely insane. Coding fell to the end of th eline. Lately, I have been able to refocus and its been great!

It was a bit of a challenge at first, trying to remember all of the small details but it came back to me. The Sinatra project was the biggest jump for me thus far. When i started the project i couldn't imagine starting with a black slate. I now feel like i've been doing this for a long time. This project gave me so much confidence in coding. 
I will say, i still get extremely frustrated with CSS, but nothing is perfect. 

I am very excited to moved forward with the program into the rails section.
