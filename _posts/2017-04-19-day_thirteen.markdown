  Today i sat down with the intentions of getting a lot done. I finished the reading of one lesson and moved on to the next lab. Once i took a look at the lab and pondered where the hell i was even going to start, I decided that I needed to go back and take a few more notes.
	
	The current section i'm on contains (what seems to me) pretty complex coding. We are past just creating arrays and we are now starting iterating through nested arrays. 
	
	I felt pretty rough when I started this morning, but after retouching the topics I actually feel pretty confident. I head to work now for the rest of the day and I'm off tomorrow, so I plan on making some real progress again tomorrow.
