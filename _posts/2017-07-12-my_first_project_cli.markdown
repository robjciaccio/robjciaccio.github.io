  After a very large amount of learning I was given my first project. The project is a Comman Line Interface project. I am currently in the market for apartments in New York, so i decided to do my project on an apartment search in, you guessed it, New York City.

  This project was very challenging as it took me using information in which I hadn't focused on in a few months. This was the first time I was given a blank slate. When we work on the labs, we are always given code that is already there, either the .gitignore, the readme, or even an already created class or environment. In this project, it was all on me. It felt very empowering to put the pieces together and eventually create something that worked. it felt amazing to try and get something to work without checking constantly to see if a test was passing. 
	
	This project was defenitely an aha moment for me. I learned a lot having to put all of the pieces I learned into action. What I learned the most from this project was something about myself. If I stop focusing on getting the tests to pass and focus more on getting the code to do what the test is asking, I believe I will advance much further in my learnings.
