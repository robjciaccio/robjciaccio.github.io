I have finally moved to New York! After being here for a week i have been to the campus three times and gotten tons of work done. It feels amazing being surrounded by so many people attempting the same things as me. I see people struggling, succeeding, and working towards their futures, its amazing.

I am in a very exciting part of the program right now as I've just finished learning rack and intro to Sinatra. These are especially exciting because they are the first glimpse of turning ruby into the internet. I have a project coming up soon at the end of this unit, which I am very excited about. 

I would say that It took me about half of this course before I became accustomed to how to learn and take notes through learn. Now I feel so much more comfortable in everything I am doing. I struggled so much in my CLI project, I am excited to do this project and really have fun with it in a confident way. 

Today I am starting the section on capybara. This is a section I have been nervous about since the beginning. Once I am done with this section I will no longer only be reading rspec tests, I will also be writing them. Update on that, comming soon.
