I have finished with Object Oriented Ruby and now we are working on databases with sqlite. I have to say, I actually really like sql. It comes off as very practical for me. I believe that this will be a very valuable asset when it comes to creating web apps. 
My partner and I are moving to New York City, and I am very excited to have the oportunity to finish my online web development course in and around Flatiron School campus. I believe it will be a great oportunity for me to become a better programmer, being surrounded by so many great minds.
