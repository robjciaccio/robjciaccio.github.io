  I was 27, managing a starbucks, bringing in a good salary, and the most unhappy I had ever been. i was so confused at how I could have everything I strived for, and be so miserable at the same time. I had known that I wanted to be a software engineer for many years, but how could I go back to school with such a demanding job. 
  
	After telling myself that I wanted to go back to school for over a year, I finally decided to go for it. I quit my job and applied to the local community college. I had to get another full time job, but not a life consuming job with a mangement role. 
	
	After being in school for a year and doing plenty of research on bootcamps and the future of the tech industry, I decided i wanted to test the waters of a coding bootcamp. I researched and researched and Flatiron seemed like the obvious choice. I applied, interviewed, and here I am, 9 days into the online web developer bootcamp. 
	
	This blog will hopefully give others what I was looking for while researching coding bootcamps. What is it like to actually be in a coding bootcamp? What is it like day in and day out to balance life, work, and learning a new career?
